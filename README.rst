Project Euler
=============

Read the `doc/build/html/index.html <Documentation>`_ for details.

Do not fork this.  You won't learn anything.

You **must** solve the problems on your own.

Reading my solutions might teach you a little bit of Python. But until you
tackle the problems and solve them, you aren't learning as much as you could.

I've placed this here so I can work from two computers.

I'm too cheap to pay for a private repo.
